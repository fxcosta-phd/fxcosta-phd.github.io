  abstract: Humans present sex-driven biological differences. Consequently, the prevalence of analyzing specific diseases and comorbidities differs between the sexes, directly impacting patients’ management and treatment. Despite its relevance and the growing evidence of said differences across numerous diseases (with 4,370 PubMed results published within the past year), knowledge at the comorbidity level remains limited. In fact, to date, no study has attempted to identify the biological processes altered differently in women and men, promoting differences in comorbidities. To shed light on this problem, we analyze expression data for more than 100 diseases from public repositories, analyzing each sex independently. We calculate similarities between differential expression profiles by disease pairs and find that 13-16% of transcriptomically similar disease pairs are sex-specific. By comparing these results with epidemiological evidence, we recapitulate 53-60% of known comorbidities distinctly described for men and women, finding sex-specific transcriptomic similarities between sex-specific comorbid diseases. The analysis of shared underlying pathways shows that diseases can co-occur in men and women by altering alternative biological processes. Finally, we identify different drugs differentially associated with comorbid diseases depending on patients’ sex, highlighting the need to consider this relevant variable in the administration of drugs due to their possible influence on comorbidities.

- title: Quantifying edge relevance for epidemic spreading via the semi-metric topology of complex networks [2023]
  authors: David Soriano Paños, Felipe Xavier Costa, Luis M. Rocha
  abstract: Sparsification aims at extracting a reduced core of associations that best preserves both the dynamics and topology of networks while reducing the computational cost of simulations. We show that the semi-metric topology of complex networks yields a natural and algebraically-principled sparsification that outperforms existing methods on those goals. Weighted graphs whose edges represent distances between nodes are semi-metric when at least one edge breaks the triangle inequality (transitivity). We first confirm with new experiments that the metric backbonea unique subgraph of all edges that obey the triangle inequality and thus preserve all shortest pathsrecovers Susceptible-Infected dynamics over the original non-sparsified graph. This recovery is improved when we remove only those edges that break the triangle inequality significantly, i.e., edges with large semi-metric distortion. Based on these results, we propose the new semi-metric distortion sparsification method to progressively sparsify networks in decreasing order of semi-metric distortion. Our method recovers the macro- and micro-level dynamics of epidemic outbreaks better than other methods while also yielding sparser yet connected subgraphs that preserve all shortest paths. Overall, we show that semi-metric distortion overcomes the limitations of edge betweenness in ranking the dynamical relevance of edges not participating in any shortest path, as it quantifies the existence and strength of alternative transmission pathways.
