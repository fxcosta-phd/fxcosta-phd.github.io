  abstract: Complex living systems are thought to exist at the “edge of chaos” separating the ordered dynamics of robust function from the disordered dynamics of rapid environmental adaptation. Here, a deeper inspection of 72 experimentally supported discrete dynamical models of cell processes reveals previously unobserved order on long time scales, suggesting greater rigidity in these systems than was previously conjectured. We find that propagation of internal perturbations is transient in most cases, and that even when large perturbation cascades persist, their phenotypic effects are often minimal. Moreover, we find evidence that stochasticity and desynchronization can lead to increased recovery from regulatory perturbation cascades. Our analysis relies on new measures that quantify the tendency of perturbations to spread through a discrete dynamical system. Computing these measures was not feasible using current methodology; thus, we developed a multipurpose CUDA-based simulation tool, which we have made available as the open-source Python library cubewalkers. Based on novel measures and simulations, our results suggest that—contrary to current theory—cell processes are ordered and far from the edge of chaos.

- title: Effective Connectivity and Bias Entropy Improve Prediction of Dynamical Regime in Automata Networks [2023]
  authors: Felipe Xavier Costa, Jordan C Rozum, Austin M Marcus, Luis M Rocha
  abstract: Biomolecular network dynamics are thought to operate near the critical boundary between ordered and disordered regimes, where large perturbations to a small set of elements neither die out nor spread on average. A biomolecular automaton (e.g., gene, protein) typically has high regulatory redundancy, where small subsets of regulators determine activation via collective canalization. Previous work has shown that effective connectivity, a measure of collective canalization, leads to improved dynamical regime prediction for homogeneous automata networks. We expand this by (i) studying random Boolean networks (RBNs) with heterogeneous in-degree distributions, (ii) considering additional experimentally validated automata network models of biomolecular processes, and (iii) considering new measures of heterogeneity in automata network logic. We found that effective connectivity improves dynamical regime prediction in the models considered; in RBNs, combining effective connectivity with bias entropy further improves the prediction. Our work yields a new understanding of criticality in biomolecular networks that accounts for collective canalization, redundancy, and heterogeneity in the connectivity and logic of their automata models. The strong link we demonstrate between criticality and regulatory redundancy provides a means to modulate the dynamical regime of biochemical networks.
